# Bolt Network Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

Hooray it’s my last project for this Codecademy class! I was pretty pleased what a nice ramp up the 15 of them provided.

I underestimated the difficulty of this one; there were some interesting challenges with the columns and responsiveness. 

At some point I’ll dig more into Bootstrap as these projects intended, but for now I’m glad I got a better grasp on vanilla CSS.

Codecademy’s example layout for this project is <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/newsroom/index.html">here</a>.
