# Newsroom Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

Hooray it’s my last project for this Codecademy class! I was pretty pleased what a nice ramp-up the 15 of them provided.

I underestimated the difficulty of this one; there were some interesting challenges with the columns and responsiveness. 

At some point I’ll dig more into Bootstrap as these projects intended, but for now I’m glad I got a better grasp on "vanilla" CSS.
